# Sonar Signals Data Analysis
## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of sonar signals data using various data visualization techniques in Python. The goal is to understand the distribution of numerical features and explore relationships between them, particularly focusing on classifying the sonar signals.

## Data
<ul>
<li> Dataset: The dataset used in this project contains 208 samples, each with 60 numerical features and a target variable Class indicating the type of object (e.g., Rock or Mine).</li>
<li> Columns: The dataset consists of 61 columns:</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
    <li> V1 to V60: Numerical features representing various properties of sonar signals.</li>
     <li> Class: The target variable with categorical values.</li>
  </ul>  
  
 ## Project Structure
<ul>
<li> data/: Contains the dataset (sonar_signals.csv).</li>
<li>notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for analysis and visualization.</li>
<li>src/: Source code for data processing and visualization.</li>
<li>README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions.</li>
<li>requirements.txt: List of required Python packages.</li>
</ul>

## Requirements
To run the analysis, you will need the following Python packages:
<ul>
<li>pandas </li>
<li>numpy </li>
<li>matplotlib </li>
<li>seaborn </li>
  </ul>


You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
## Usage

 ###  1. Data Loading and Preprocessing 
 
The dataset is loaded using pandas, and basic preprocessing steps are performed, such as handling missing values and ensuring the data types are correct.

### 2. Data Visualization

Several types of visualizations are performed:
<ul>
<li> Correlation Matrix: To understand the relationships between the numerical features and the target variable.</li>
<li> Histograms: To visualize the distribution of each numerical feature. </li>
<li> Density Plots: To analyze the density distribution of numerical features.</li>
<li> Customized Visualizations: Different colors are assigned to each plot to improve readability and visual appeal.</li>
  </ul>

### 3. Running the Project
You can run the project by executing the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts. For example, to visualize the density plots with different colors:

```bash
python src/density_plots.py
```

Alternatively, you can open the notebooks in the notebooks/ directory and run the cells step by step.

### Project Highlights
<ul>
<li>Custom Visualizations: The project demonstrates how to customize colors in density plots and how to visualize multiple plots in a single figure.</li>
<li>Comprehensive Analysis: Each numerical feature is analyzed individually and in relation to others.</li>
  </ul>
